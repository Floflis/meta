- loop in drives until Windows is found
-
- Floflis Manager for Windows: detect the location of Windows drive. If more than one, ask which one is preferred by user. Detect Windows version of every drive (Screens Explorer will use this to display icons for every version). Will take use of list-devices.sh that writes all data (drives, types, infos, free/used space, etc) into JSON

add to Floflis Docs: Floflis isn't made for shared/multiuser computers (yet)

Flf gitcoin
It will use Ethereum+ENS and IPFS for its own related updates; but you will not miss your APT's and untouched Ubuntu's updates you are already comfortable with.

"For a few years Ubuntu-based distros were a bit of a meme. They were considered low-effort reskins offering few substantive differences. Oh, how the times have changed!"
[omgubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/12/best-linux-distro-releases-in-2021).

Flof advanced forms:
- Ubuntu x86
- Ubuntu ARM
- Manjaro+KDE Plasma ARM+x86
- Ubuntu RISC-V
- Redox

- Eventlr count fix

Floflis Blog: arch old posts
g nltcs

- compare Internet Cat's read-from-input-value with Screens Explorer's own

- Floflis Packager: sign with ETH address
- Floflis Application Handler: display publisher and validate ETH sign

- Floflis Packager tasks.txt annotate: in addition to supporting usual ETH signing, also support by-DAO signatures (both offchain - EIP like in Snapshot - and onchain)

Floflis' philosophy about duplication: de-duplicate files always; except for backups. Incentive user to understand why backups are essential

- icons for Screens Explorer, Writer, Personal Issues, Eventlr (new icon), Internet Cat, Alertz, .nu file
- Use from-Windows icons

- screenshot in repos' README.md (Explorer, Central, Writer, Personal Issues, Floflis Application Handler, Chatip)
- tmp.txt: repos to push/upload

.nu handler will identify when file isn't marked as executable and, like Java, will warn (will use the executable-warn.sh shared script that may be used by Floflis Application Handler)

- experiment with site clonning through addon (gipfs)
- Fix newtab addon (and submit)
- test Messaging fx addon
- Fix Internet Cat
- Merge newtab into Internet Cat

musiclr anotate task: decide the amount of musics to play until the next shuffle (default: 5)

- BR IR environment (Neyma Receita - eth.floflis.neymareceita)
re-work NFT generator (duplication loopingsearch for every new NFT to be generated)

- Study about how the .game format will use a package.json with strict permissions and more security restrictions
This package.json will be forced when the app is extracted into /tmp, before it loads.

- Floflis Packager: mark if app have blur effect
- linux-icons-generator: installer
- Floflis Packager: when installing, process app's icon and .desktop
- Floflis Packager: .desktop info at manifest.webapp

! document !
- httb add/edit site (Site Maker not available yet - add Site Maker to projmap)
- httb config file
- httb $variables in HTML (will be changed)
- httb /custom (scripts, db)
- Floflis Packager (pre-export (Kongregate), initpreview, pack; manifest.webapp, exports folder and its HTML/scripts - also exemplified in FMWK for C2) and update FMWK for C2 with these docs
- Floflis Docs (online and other utilities/tools)

Floflis Status server: temporarily disable nginx and test httb
Works?
Make test HTTPS site with nginx+certbot. then replace nginx to test httb's HTTPS support
Probably httb will able to identify an HTTPS request, but won't be able to read nor send because of no handshake using the installed cert

- restore Peeper Poster (and the data folder and imgs) and prepare to add it to Floflis' next builds

Floflis ETH key assist will detect GUI, then open its Electron app.
This app will spawn a Floflis Connect popup window and begin session

profile.floflis.com:
- get profile photo from ENS (know when profile photo is normal or if NFT display in hexagon)
- get other profile data from ENS
- if no ENS data, enable user to fill this data so it will be stored in Web 2.0
- future task: enable user to set NFT PFP on ENS, by creating a sign-able message that will open Floflis Connect to open a wallet sign request/window

Floflis will have a post-signup method, sending sybil/ens tt and other acknowledged info with ETH signature and server will validate; if ETH signature ok, store/update data in users.json
- httb sample web3 site: test signing messages with web3/ethers.js and console log
- login page will try to open MetaMask/use existing web3 session then login via web3 by signing message
- option to upgrade web 2.0 account to web 3.0
- support for hexagonal NFT profile pic (next Floflis build)
- httb: support to file upload (user can update profile picture and cover) with size limit for every type of request
- request adding user as friend, option to accept request
- notifications via Alertz

- Enter Floflis Status server and copy all recent commands (useful for Floflis Server)

- In separate server, install nginx, domain and https. This server will be floflisconnect.com. User logs with Web3 wallet through Web3Modal and, through its identified URL data (floflisconnect.com/popup#http://ip.ip.ip.ip:8080), send back POST data to the site that openned the popup (this data is user's ETH address and signed message with nonce)
- httb signup form: two options: web 2.0 and web 3.0.
Web 2.0 / Web3 tabs are also part of the Floflis Connect HTML
if web3: open wallet through Framework Web3 and get ETH address. Use ETH address as username. All inputs will be deactivated until ETH address appears and, after that, username input remain deactivated. server will put a character limit on web 2.0 usernames, and validate web 3.0 usernames both at login/signup (starts with 0x, character count)
- move httb floflis to new, definitive server
- Security steps for both Floflis Profile and Floflis Connect
- Floflis Profile annotate task: send confirmation email before proceeding with signup
- Floflis Status server: log profile.floflis.com and floflisconnect.com status
- Floflis Profile site will tell about the importance of backups as "passwords" cannot be reset- Floflis Packager anotate task: move application IDs to reverse format (eth.floflis.central) for next build
Next build anotate about Floflis Central and Floflis Packager tasks. At next build, changing background will also change Floflis Profile's cover; same for Linux username and avatar

- httb annotate task: support character/bytes limit on received data (character limits on post/password form, bytes limits on uploaded data/files depending on mimetype)

- research about offline github issues and how Personal Issues/Issues Editor could be merged

.sss (screensaver) handler; use the same or better sandbox as for .game; close after mouse moves or any button pressed/input detected)

- httb: own 404 error page unless user have sett its own (conf.json)
- httb: use variable in login.html and signup.html to display errors
- httb install: if /var/www/html is empty, add starter .html file
- httb sample site: better 404 error page
- httb initializing: check if html folder exists before running
- httb sample site: use FrameworkJS (but merge original CSS into FrameworkJS dark theme, for FMWK r3)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- httb: move some functions to /custom as external scripts (at login/signup functions, check if there are overhides before running)
- example site will have update.sh and install.sh
- example site will be renamed to Framework HTTB and referenced in HTTB readme.md
-
- httb checks if ncat/jq/mlq are installed and if not, install (mlq will be downloaded from gh before plugz, annotate this task)
-
- httb logs the htmlfolder and port used, when started

How Floflis is different, and the incubator of Web3:

- create server for PS server 1 for testing
- create server for PS server 2 for testing
Each one using a different boilerplate.
Later these servers may be merged.
Their NodeJS script will communicate with Bash, firing event on every buck transfer (cmnchn)
-
PokÃ©Showdown bot:
- rename XPS to WPS (Wrapped PokeShowdown bucks)
- get username that is sending a message
- get the amount of bucks a user messaging have (commit)
-
- cmd to exchange bucks to XPS (ask ETH address (pre-signup) if no ETH address and validate it, check if XPS hotwallet reserve is ok, detect bucks transfer then send from hot wallet)
- every 6 hours, detect the total supply of bucks a server have; also snapshot userlist's balances
- cmd to exchange XPS to bucks (check if bucks reserve is ok, tell the required ETH address to send from and the ETH address to send to and also how to submit support request, detect XPS was received, then send the server's native bucks)
-
- Floflis Connect: store all signed (private or public)
- command to signup so it stores user's ETH address; open Floflis Connect to sign a message then finish proof of owning

Discord nitro for Floflis server
Discord nitro for Plasmmer server
Bitbol
Maki.gg premium for Plasmmer server

Change maki.gg settings; every server will distribute daily the same candies amount as CoinGecko

- search: Discord bot with Bash

- Bot that sends commands to Maki.gg; it should be able to then parse/read user's balance and then take/convert
- Floflis shouldn't permit candy claims in Floflis Central if they're already claimed from the Discord server and vice-versa; this will mean Floflis Discord should have its own bot

Merged Firefox OS/KaiOS 2.5:
- Detect new Gecko version then "port" to new APIs if newer version is detected

Development platform of NeTVision Box:
- Built-in soundfonts (.sf2) such as 8Bit and MIDI interpreter JS (but games can use their own also)

test KaiOS sim in other Ubuntu
if ok, test FMWK and Pocket Kitten
test replacing KaiOS Gaia by FirefoxOS Gaia

- fix Pocket Kitten relative URL in manifest.webapp
fmwk r3:
- put JS into "js/" folder
- own repository for "app/", site and UI (UI uses FMWK Base)
- research about getting CSS/JS from node module (if FMWK r3's CSS can work directly from calling from module so as it is possible with JS)
- mkdocs for fmwk base

Test Capy and with David Launcher
