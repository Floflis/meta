How Floflis is different, and the incubator of Web3:
- IPFS under the hood
- Native system-wide Wallet (Frame)
- Support for Ledger/other hardware wallets
- #PlayAndEarn built-in
- User/sync account logged by ETH address
- Token and NFT listing (user's Inventory)
- NFT'ed user Pic and desktop Background

- restructure /1 folder
- fl ppl (add new; .ppl file; ETH address, IPFS p ID)

- Study about how the .game format will use a package.json with strict permissions and more security restrictions
This package.json will be forced when the app is extracted into /tmp, before it loads.

- Floflis Packager: mark if app have blur effect
- linux-icons-generator: installer
- Floflis Packager: when installing, process app's icon and .desktop
- Floflis Packager: .desktop info at manifest.webapp

- restore Peeper Poster (and the data folder and imgs) and prepare to add it to Floflis' next builds
- research about offline github issues and how Personal Issues/Issues Editor could be merged
Personal Issues absolute path:
/1/data/issues?
add to Floflis Docs: Floflis isn't made for shared/multiuser computers (yet), going the opposite way that smartphones did

- Floflis' Internet shortcut apps' icon generator (at Floflis Icons installer)
- HTML5Apps Platform: app listing .sh (loop in /1/apps and /1/games and lists all, categorized)
- HTML5Apps Platform annotate task: emulate SD card/internal storage then get support for Firefox OS/KaiOS/Cordova APIs
- HTML5Apps Platform annotate task: Android build, inspired by Firefox and Hermit. Run Cordova/Firefox/KaiOS apps from a single runtime

- Floflis Packager: sign with ETH address
- Floflis Application Handler: display publisher and validate ETH sign

claim candy
flf mem gme
- daily candy claim remind
- if a week without claiming candy, snd notif

HTML5Apps Platform placeholder app, with its own CLI and support to notifs and screensavers APIs
-
Central own cli for updating desktop background (not a priority - already have a work)
-
floapi app, which app uses for example to request pinning (uses permissions)

- Floflis Central: Profile
- Floflis Central Personalization: backgrounds, sounds, avatars
-
first boot UI wizard
- taskbar position
- taskbar icons size
- ask to connect the Internet
- if no avatar both locally and ENS (or no Internet), offer to choose avatar (tell can use NFT avatar later or if there's Internet already found NFT avatars then show list)
- get avatar from ENS and tell about that, but still offer to choose avatar (if ENS avatar isn't NFT then tell can use NFT avatar later or if found NFT avatars then show list)
- desktop shrtcts such as Face and other sites/games
- ask if indi gamedev (then suggest fsx/gdevelop), yt/ttk/streammer, musician (suggest Roll)
-
- app Axie, PoolTogether, The Giving Block, Lido, Fractional, Alchemix, YFI, Roll, Showtime, Ncities, https://app.rabbithole.gg/skills

- license and token limit for frks like UniOS; license permits to be replaced/turn more permissive if DAO votes after five years

Flf
- 1inch alternative

JSON fields: current pin (Uniswap, Aragon, etc)
current pin is updated so the previous after 5 is removed

Flf gitcoin
It will use Ethereum+ENS and IPFS for its own related updates; but you will not miss your APT's and untouched Ubuntu's updates you are already comfortable with.

"For a few years Ubuntu-based distros were a bit of a meme. They were considered low-effort reskins offering few substantive differences. Oh, how the times have changed!"

Floflis Blog: arch old posts
g nltcs

- Floflis Packager tasks.txt annotate: in addition to supporting usual ETH signing, also support by-DAO signatures (both offchain - EIP like in Snapshot - and onchain)

Floflis' philosophy about duplication: de-duplicate files always; except for backups. Incentive user to understand why backups are essential

- icons for Screens Explorer, Writer, Personal Issues, Eventlr (new icon), Internet Cat, Alertz, .nu file
- Use from-Windows icons

- BR IR environment (Neyma Receita - eth.floflis.neymareceita)
re-work NFT generator (duplication loopingsearch for every new NFT to be generated)

- apps slated to migrate to FMWK r3 (and newer versions), at projmap (USV PoC Player, Central, David Explorer, David Writer, Internet Boat/Cat, HTML5 Player, Personal Issues, Peeper Poster)



- Plugz loop reads at recipes.json and install every; also, before, installs self directly from the script that calls it
plugz -> cake (site explains its the simplest build sys and also independent dependencies)
Plugz: dont anymore use versions; use locally only



- start working at omni-packager
- test js2me on my FxOS phone (place the packaged app with the .jar files and with the packaged FrameworkJS app)
- test js2me on my KaiOS phone (place the packaged app with the .jar files and with the packaged FrameworkJS app)

Discord nitro for Floflis server
Discord nitro for Plasmmer server
Bitbol
Maki.gg premium for Plasmmer server

Change maki.gg settings; every server will distribute daily the same candies amount as CoinGecko

- search: Discord bot with Bash

- Bot that sends commands to Maki.gg; it should be able to then parse/read user's balance and then take/convert
- Floflis shouldn't permit candy claims in Floflis Central if they're already claimed from the Discord server and vice-versa; this will mean Floflis Discord should have its own bot

Development platform of NeTVision Box:
- Built-in soundfonts (.sf2) such as 8Bit and MIDI interpreter JS (but games can use their own also)
- Built-in node_modules such as DualShock 4 gamepad support
- Built-in C2 plugins/addons (NFC, SVG, HTML, etc)
- Can put built-in things on your game for other platforms (Floflis Packager)
- Floflis 20, Firedoge OS and Floflis Screens will get the same platform as of NeTVision ?

Floflis:
- HTML5 Player app
-
- ask if PC is shared or single-user
- ðŸŒ³ folder: separate users in folders if this is a setting
- "floflis add frnd" cmd (stored in JSON - detect user data folder if ðŸŒ³ or other)
