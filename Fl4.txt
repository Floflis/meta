- It doesnt have Web3 because it wants to be the next frontier on OSes; because it wants to be the next frontier on OSes that it will ALSO have Web3.
- File deduplication
- Linux distros should be developed not with a eyeglass, an idea to fix other distros, coffee and some abilities; they should be developed with love. That's why they should be built 100% in Bash/Shell+JS/HTML/CSS (lets democratize visual event-sheets) and that's why "The year of the Linux in Desktop" did never came.
- preserve folder's snapshots
- crowd archival of ipfs sites

- Why don't we get inspired by git and (urgently, gently) de-duplicate the Web? In 100 years, we'll have more bits than atoms on Earth
- Why aren't our screenshot files split in parts, containing HTML/CSS/SVG replacing lots of pixels? This could be also merged/intersected with my idea of file de-duplication.
- Why having a whole new separated video coded to react/duet/reply to another video, when videos could simply be containers building on the top of other? You could deduplicate (and save) a lot of (mega)bytes by just linking a video on the video that wants to insert it. Also, mentioning the previous item: why lots of pixels to have texts/figures on your videos when they could simply be in HTML/CSS/SVG (even the transitions, in CSS)?
- Git does deduplicate texty files such as HTML/CSV/XML/etc. Shouldn't it also deduplicate the audio's wave forms, images and the same as video frames+audio? Git was primarily made for developers (which mostly uses texty files, obviously), but what about LFS and the app/game's assets? Also, git have the potential for uses beyond the dev space. These advanced deduplicing capabilities shouldn't necessarily be added to git, but to a layer2 for it (or in competitors such as Pijul or a layer2 for both git and/or these competitors/alternatives)



all sites: banner image when sharing link and meta

Personal site:
- disclaimer:
- policies section: forks dont replace upstream - instead contributes or implements a specific feature need - unless they are abandn; I know when its not the time for something, so I'm not anymore too much interested in seasteads (they pose a risk until its the right time)
- acts section: I didnt threatnd Rnbw; instead I discussed about DAO licenses while receiving skptism months before Uniswap v3 had its own license; as in the [policies section](), I dont fork to call my own nor frontrun (like CRV) unless its a simpler pj like WEI
- pjs section: Ogt will not have all or most of Facebook features; instead, it will focus on its own (scraps, communities, blogs, gifts, PeepAndEarn orkoins)
I want to preserve Facebook because its important the human hst
I signed the Interdependence Manifesto but Mark Zuckerberg already told he's commited for a Metaverse not exclusive of a single company but distributed
Facebook and Ogt have their own niche just as Facebook and Twitter can coexist
- Flf will use Ethereum+ENS and IPFS for its own related updates; but you will not miss your APT's and untouched Ubuntu's updates you are already comfortable with; this isnt a full decentralized Web3 experience, but an experiment using Infu and IPFS gateways
- Plasmmer will have no CEO, but probably it will require tech leads in their own areas; no OPI nor founder holding, but at treasury
- agon client will not remove branding nor add any kind of ad/link of our own.
XDai will be later removed and P cstm client will cease; after ensuring Reddit tokens are available on other chains
This client will use ANT tokens as the official
