Flufluntu: Floflis with GNOME
https://diolinux.com.br/noticias/extension-manager-gnome.html

Floflis identify OLED screen
Built-in hardware display brightness slider
Identify hardware+driver that works (such as microphone) and identify when it stopped working (and after what event it did happened, in Floflis Events/Journaling)

Floflis' handy scripts:
- list all files present in a folder that are missing in another
- list all files in a folder and check (by hash) if they're present in another folder

- Floflis Screens fix
- Floflis Screens re-work/new features
- Floflis Screens pure > C2

- start working on Floflis PCB (armhf, arm64) and test release on boards (this will also start Floflis Grants - for example, for compiling Starship for other archs)
- take use of ". ./path/.test.sh" or ". ./test.sh" and "export variable"
- next Floflis builds will add new apps such as Firedoge, enable UniOS, move from to-merge.sh into proper layers and start working on Floflis Update (both CLI and UI)

Preserve files unlike OS timestamps and services like Mega are doing

Fubuntu: the same Ubuntu using GNOME and its themes; but with Floflis layers, Starship, Cicada (Bash), and Floflis Central
