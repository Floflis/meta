test KaiOS sim in other Ubuntu
if ok, test FMWK and Pocket Kitten
test replacing KaiOS Gaia by FirefoxOS Gaia

- fix Pocket Kitten relative URL in manifest.webapp
fmwk r3:
- put JS into "js/" folder
- own repository for "app/", site and UI (UI uses FMWK Base)
- research about getting CSS/JS from node module (if FMWK r3's CSS can work directly from calling from module so as it is possible with JS)
- mkdocs for fmwk base

Test Capy and with David Launcher

Merged Firefox OS/KaiOS 2.5:
- Detect new Gecko version then "port" to new APIs if newer version is detected
